Dungeon Generation, Monsters, and Pathfinding

- This project generates a randomized dungeon with rooms, corridors, and staircases (< for upstairs, > for downstairs), ensuring full accessibility. Dijkstra’s Algorithm is used for pathfinding, allowing non-tunneling monsters to move through open spaces and tunneling monsters to dig through walls, with movement costs based on hardness.

- Monsters have distinct AI traits: intelligence (smart pathfinding), telepathy (always knows player location), tunneling (can dig through walls), and erratic behavior (random movement). The player ('@') moves randomly, and the game runs on an event-driven system where entity speed determines turn order.
The game can save and load dungeons with './dungeon --save "filename"' and './dungeon --load "filename"'. Running './dungeon "number"' spawns 1-15 monsters. The game ends when the player is defeated. 

- After launching the game with ./dungeon "number of monsters", press any button to start the game. Press "F" to toggle Fog of War mode, limiting visibility to a radius around the player. Press 'M' to display a scrollable list of all monsters in the dungeon, showing their symbol and relative position from the player (e.g., "e, 2 south and 6 east"). Scroll through the monster list using the arrow keys, and press ESC to exit the list and return to normal gameplay. Do 25+ monsters to check the Arrow Scrolling.

- This project is now fully written in C++ and follows an object-oriented design using classes for the PC, NPCs, and general characters. As of version 1.06, a Fog of War mechanic has been introduced—players can only see dungeon tiles within a radius of 3, and previously seen terrain is remembered. Debugging features like fog toggling (f) and teleportation (g) have also been added for easier navigation and testing.
