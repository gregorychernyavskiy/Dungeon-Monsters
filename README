Dungeon Monsters
Overview:
- A C++ roguelike dungeon crawler generating randomized dungeons with rooms (.), corridors (#), and staircases (< for upstairs, > for downstairs).
- Uses Dijkstra’s Algorithm for pathfinding: non-tunneling monsters navigate open spaces, tunneling monsters dig through walls (cost based on hardness).
- Monsters have AI traits: intelligent (smart pathfinding), telepathic (knows player location), tunneling (breaks walls), erratic (random movement).
- Player (@) navigates the dungeon; turn order is event-driven based on speed.
- Supports saving/loading dungeons and spawning monsters; game ends on player defeat or boss victory (SpongeBob SquarePants).

Prerequisites:
- C++ compiler (g++ with C++11 support).
- ncurses library (sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev on Ubuntu).
- Linux/Unix system (uses $HOME/.rlg327/ for file storage).

Compile the Project:
- Run make to compile into the dungeon executable.

Clean the Project:
- Run make clean to remove compiled files.

Generate a New Dungeon:
- Run ./dungeon to create a new dungeon.

Save the Dungeon:
- Run ./dungeon --save "filename" to save to $HOME/.rlg327/filename.

Load a Saved Dungeon:
- Run ./dungeon --load "filename" to load from $HOME/.rlg327/filename.

Populate Dungeon with Monsters (1-15):
- Run ./dungeon "number of monsters" (e.g., ./dungeon 10).

Start the Game:
- After launching, press any key to begin.

Movement:
- Use y,7 / k,8 / u,9 for up-left / up / up-right.
- Use h,4 / l,6 for left / right.
- Use b,1 / j,2 / n,3 for down-left / down / down-right.

Fog of War:
- Press 'F' to toggle Fog of War (3-tile radius visibility).
- Previously seen terrain is remembered for navigation.

View Monster List:
- Press 'M' to display a scrollable list of monsters (symbol, name, position, e.g., "p (Junior Barbarian), 2 south, 6 east").

Teleportation:
- Press 'G' to enter teleportation mode.

Item Pickup and Auto-Wear:
- Press 'w' when standing on an item (e.g., sword |, armor [) to pick up and auto-equip to the appropriate slot (e.g., Weapon, Armor, Ring).
- If slot is occupied, swaps with equipped item (old item moves to inventory if space exists).
- If no inventory space, item stays on the floor ("Inventory full!").

Wear from Inventory:
- Press 'w' to equip an item from inventory (slots 0-9).
- Select a slot (0-9); item equips, swapping with any existing item in the slot.
- If item can’t be equipped, shows "Item cannot be equipped!".
- Press ESC to cancel.

Take Off Item:
- Press 't' to move an equipped item (slots a-l) to an inventory slot (0-9).
- Select a slot (a-l, e.g., 'a' for Weapon); requires an empty inventory slot.

Combat:
- Forced Combat: Move into a monster’s cell (or vice versa) to start turn-based combat.
- Attack: Press 'a' to attack, rolling your damage dice (base 0+1d4 if no weapon, plus equipped items’ dice). Damage reduces the monster’s hitpoints.
- Flee: Press 'f' for a 30% chance to escape combat. If successful, combat ends; if not, the monster attacks.
- Monster Attack: After your turn, the monster rolls its damage dice (e.g., 0+1d4 for SpongeBob). If your hitpoints reach zero, the game ends (loss).

Item Persistence:
- Inventory (slots 0-9) and equipment (slots a-l) persist when using stairs ('<' or '>'), ensuring items are not lost between levels.
