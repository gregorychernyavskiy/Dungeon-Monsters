Dungeon Generation:

This project generates a randomized dungeon layout in a terminal environment. 
It follows specific rules to create and connect rooms. 
The dungeon features randomized room placement, stairs and spacing, with loops (corridors) to prevent dead ends. 
The program is compiled using make and launched with ./dungeon_generation.
