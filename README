Dungeon Generation, Monsters, and Pathfinding

- This project generates a randomized dungeon with rooms, corridors, and staircases (< for upstairs, > for downstairs), ensuring full accessibility. Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm is used for pathfinding, allowing non-tunneling monsters to move through open spaces and tunneling monsters to dig through walls, with movement costs based on hardness.

- Monsters have distinct AI traits: intelligence (smart pathfinding), telepathy (always knows player location), tunneling (can dig through walls), and erratic behavior (random movement). The player ('@') moves randomly, and the game runs on an event-driven system where entity speed determines turn order.
The game can save and load dungeons with './dungeon --save "filename"' and './dungeon --load "filename"'. Running './dungeon "number"' spawns 1-15 monsters. The game ends when the player is defeated.

Compile the project:
make

Clean the Project:
make clean

Generate a new dungeon:         
./dungeon

Save the dungeon:
./dungeon --save "filename"

Load a saved dungeon:
./dungeon --load "filename"

Populate dungeon with monsters (between 1 and 15):
./dungeon "number of monsters" (1-15)
