Dungeon Generation, Monsters, and Pathfinding
- This project is a fully object-oriented C++ roguelike dungeon crawler that generates randomized dungeons featuring rooms, corridors, and staircases ('<' for upstairs, '>' for downstairs), ensuring full accessibility across the map. It employs Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm for pathfinding, enabling non-tunneling monsters to navigate open spaces and tunneling monsters to dig through walls, with movement costs determined by terrain hardness. Monsters possess distinct AI traits: intelligence (smart pathfinding to the player), telepathy (constant awareness of player location), tunneling (ability to break through walls), and erratic behavior (random movement), adding variety to gameplay. The player, represented by '@', navigates the dungeon, while an event-driven system dictates turn order based on entity speed. The game supports saving and loading dungeons using ./dungeon --save "filename" and ./dungeon --load "filename", and running ./dungeon "number" spawns monsters, ending when the player is defeated.

- To start the game, launch ./dungeon "number of monsters" and press any key to begin. Players can toggle Fog of War mode with 'F', restricting visibility to a 3-tile radius around the player, with previously seen terrain remembered for strategic navigation. Pressing 'M' displays a scrollable list of all monsters in the dungeon, detailing their symbol and relative position (e.g., "e, 2 south and 6 east"); use arrow keys to scroll (test with 25+ monsters to verify scrolling) and ESC to return to gameplay. Debugging features enhance testing: 'F' toggles fog, and 'G' activates teleportation mode for quick repositioning. As of version 1.06, these mechanics were introduced alongside a shift to C++ classes for the PC, NPCs, and general characters, ensuring a modular design.

- New to version 1.07, the project includes robust parsing capabilities for monster and item definitions, accessible via ./dungeon --parse-monsters and ./dungeon --parse-objects. These commands read from $HOME/.rlg327/monster_desc.txt and $HOME/.rlg327/object_desc.txt.
