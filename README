Dungeon Generation, Monsters, and Pathfinding

- This project generates a randomized dungeon with rooms, corridors, and staircases (< for upstairs, > for downstairs), ensuring full accessibility. Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm is used for pathfinding, allowing non-tunneling monsters to move through open spaces and tunneling monsters to dig through walls, with movement costs based on hardness.

- Monsters have distinct AI traits: intelligence (smart pathfinding), telepathy (always knows player location), tunneling (can dig through walls), and erratic behavior (random movement). The player ('@') moves randomly, and the game runs on an event-driven system where entity speed determines turn order.
The game can save and load dungeons with './dungeon --save "filename"' and './dungeon --load "filename"'. Running './dungeon "number"' spawns 1-15 monsters. The game ends when the player is defeated.

Compile the project:
make

Clean the Project:
make clean

Generate a new dungeon:         
./dungeon

Save the dungeon:
./dungeon --save "filename"

Load a saved dungeon:
./dungeon --load "filename"

Populate dungeon with monsters (between 1 and 15):
./dungeon "number of monsters" (1-15)

Start the Game with Fog of War:
After launching the game with ./dungeon "number of monsters", press f to toggle Fog of War mode, limiting visibility to a radius around the player.

View Monster List:
Press 'M' to display a scrollable list of all monsters in the dungeon, showing their symbol and relative position from the player (e.g., "e, 2 south and 6 east"). Scroll through the monster list using the arrow keys, and press ESC to exit the list and return to normal gameplay. Do 25+ monsters to check the Arrow Scrolling.
